    "Title": "[center]Circular\nTable\nSaw[/center]",
    "Description": "[fill]There are many electrical machines which, for safety reasons, must not start automatically after a power failure. Classically realised with a reset-dominated self-retaining contactor circuit and separate ON and OFF buttons.\nAs an introductory example, a controller for a [b]table saw[/b] should be modelled. When the ON button is pressed, the machine should turn on by activating the motor. If the OFF button is pressed, the machine should turn off by cutting the power to the motor. If both buttons are pressed at the same time, the motor shall be off.[/fill]",
    "Goal": "[fill]Create a sequential function chart to switch the table saw on or off.[/fill]",

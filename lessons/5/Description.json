    "Description": "In a (maybe) fictional scenario Dr. Rosenberg explores the areas outside of the classical concept of matter. The task is described by Dr. Rosenberg:\n'When we start the process, the two carts (we simply call them [b]Emitter[/b] and [b]Focus[/b]) need to be at the frontal position and turned on together. This will build up the needed mass in the central trap which can already be heated up to the needed 2000k with the [b]laser[/b]. If the targeted mass is hit, turn off the Emitter and move it back, as it is not used anymore. When the temperature and the mass is correct, we want to turn on the [b]field generator[/b], turn off the Focus and move the Focus back as fast as possible to prevent damage on the (kind of expensive) pole. [i](We still need to think about how to improve this part)[/i]. If everything went correct, we should observe a vertical discharge and record it. May be we come closer to a new type of spectrometers.'",
    "Goal": "Automate the process to be quick but prevent damage and unnecessary waste.",

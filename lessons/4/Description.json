    "Description": "[fill]You are hired to build the emergency visualisation and reset behaviour system for an experimental reactor.\n\nThe task is described by Dr. Rosenberg as follows:\n'In case something goes wrong with the experiment and charged particles escape in the chamber, we want a controlled reset.\nIf the [b]emergency state[/b] triggers, the [b]emergency warning light[/b] must be turned on, the [b]tank pressure[/b] refilled quickly to 2000hpa, and the [b]battery voltage[/b] recharged to 45V.\nOperators can acknowledge the error which will turn off the emergency warning light. If every system is back to normal, we can signal to [b]reset the emergency state[/b] and return to the normal operation mode.'[fill]",

    "Title": "[center]Electrical Road Barrier[/center]",
    "Description": "[fill]There are various electric road barriers installed to prevent vehicle access. As an introductory example to branches, we use a simple [b]barrier with a motor[/b] to raise or lower the barrier and [b]sensors to detect the opened or closed position[/b]. A Guard in the right green building next to the barrier always signals when the road should be blocked or passable.[/fill]",
    "Goal": "[fill]Create a sequential function chart to let vehicles pass the checkpoint according to the guards signal. Think about all error cases![/fill]",

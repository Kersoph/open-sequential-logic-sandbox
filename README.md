# Learn Sequential Logic in Time Dependant Processes

[![  Run Tests on Godot 3.3  ](https://github.com/Kersoph/open-sequential-logic-sandbox/actions/workflows/run_wat_tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Kersoph/open-sequential-logic-sandbox/actions/workflows/run_wat_tests.yml)

Build solutions for real and fictional scenarios where cyclic working controllers work in time dependant environments (e.g. Programmable Logic Controller PLC).
A programming language close to Sequential Function Chart (SFC EN 61131-3 / IEC 61131-3) is used while it is intended to add more languages later. SFC is used to learn the basic principles as it focuses exactly on the core elements of sequential logic and the control of serial or parallel tasks, is easy to learn, has similarities to petri-nets, GRAFCET, Activity Diagrams, State Machines or Statecharts and can be used to program PLCs.



### Select a Lesson

The lessons focus on different topics and have an increasing difficulty within the topics.

### Create your solution and test it

You can add breakpoints, pause the execution, reset the PLC, reset the simulation, inspect your I/O table, and observe the plant.

4. Open Godot Mono and open the downloaded project with it
5. Press F5 or the small play button on the top right corner



# Background

Learning the fundamental principle of sequential logic in time dependent processes is critical for system engineers. The aim of this project is to investigate how using modern interactive technologies informed by pedagogical principles in learning applications, specifically, those with gamifications can help the students compared to the current theoretical approaches based on text or passive media.

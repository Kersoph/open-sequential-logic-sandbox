# Learn using sequential logic in time dependant processes

[![  Run Tests on Godot 3.3  ](https://github.com/Kersoph/open-sequential-logic-sandbox/actions/workflows/run_wat_tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Kersoph/open-sequential-logic-sandbox/actions/workflows/run_wat_tests.yml)

Learning the fundamental principle of sequential logic in time dependent
processes is critical for system engineers. The aim of this project is to
investigate how using modern interactive technologies informed by
pedagogical principles in learning applications, specifically, those with
gamifications can help the students compared to the current theoretical
approaches based on text or passive media.
